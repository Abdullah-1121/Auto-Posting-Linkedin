# Post on LinkedIn - Custom GPT Automation

This project automates posting on LinkedIn using a custom GPT named "Post on LinkedIn" through Zapier webhooks. The custom GPT requires a title, body, and image URL for the post, and Zapier handles the automation of posting it to LinkedIn.

- **Title** of the LinkedIn post
